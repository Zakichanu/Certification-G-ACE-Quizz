    - Cloud Shell is a command-line tool, while the Cloud Console is a graphical user interface

    > The Cloud Console is a graphical user interface and Cloud Shell is a command-line tool. Both tools allow you to interact with Google Cloud. Even though the
    Cloud Console can do things Cloud Shell can't do and vice-versa, don’t think of them as alternatives, but think of them as one extremely flexible and powerful
    interface.
